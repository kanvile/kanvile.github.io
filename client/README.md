# Learned From D0
## Yulin Liu
Through the draft wireframe and sitemap, we show how to define the layout on paper and how to create a "language" for the site. Using the layout, we can see the different parts, different details more clearly. It will help us do HTML or CSS or JS easiler and understand how HTML or CSS works with the guide of look of the layout.
## Shengwei Ma
By drawing the hand draft of Chalkboard, I have a comprehensive and basic summary of the website (app) we are about to make. In particular, the sitemap divides the website (app) into several parts. In the subsequent web page production, we will do it separately according to different parts. Draft and sitemap are not difficult, but for those of us who have no web page production experience, we still need some time to sort out the logic.
