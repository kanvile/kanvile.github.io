           <h3>Queens College(CUNY) - New York</h3>
           <p>Computer science, 2019</p>
           <p>As a transfer student, I entered Queens college for the first time in 2014.
               My previous major was accounting, and my friend told me that accounting is a popular major,
               which is easy and simple. But after a year of study, I found that I am not good at dealing with numbers,
               economic and financial matters' things. I did not get good results in almost all subjects.
               This year of study and life made me feel that I was not suitable to continue studying, so I chose to suspend school.
               When I was 28, I suddenly realized that I can only get a better life through study.
               After serious thinking, I returned to Queens college and changed my major to computer science.
               I chose this new major because I have a great interest in computer science.</p>
